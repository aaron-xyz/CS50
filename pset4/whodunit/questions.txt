1.  What’s stdint.h?
    
    It is a header that allow us to use integers with fixed widths.
    If required also it is allowed to define integers with least, and maximum values. 
    
2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
    
    - uint8_t make sure to us that the int will be unsigned and 8 bits (1 byte) long
    - uint16_t make sure to us that the int will be unsigned and 16 bits (2 bytes) long
    - uint32_t make sure to us that the int will be unsigned and 32 bits  (4 bytes) long
    - int32_t make sure to us that the int can be signed and will be max of 32 bits (4 bytes) long
    
3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
    
    BYTE 8 bits (1 byte)
    DWORD 32 bits (4 bytes)
    LONG 32 bits (4 bytes) (signed)
    WORD 16 bits (2 bytes)
    
4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? 
    Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
    
    The bfType (WORD)
    
5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
    bfSize is the size in bytes of the bitmap file only. 
    biSize is the size in bytes of the bitmap file plus the metadata.
    
6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
    
    biHeight specifies the height of the bitmap, in pixels. If it is POSITIVE, then the origin of the image is the lower-left (BOTTOM to TOP) corner.
    On the other hand, if the value is NEGATIVE, then the origin of the image is the upper-left corner (TOP to BOTTOM).
    
7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
    
    biBitCount
    
8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
    
    In line 24 could return NULL if the file can't be open or can't be found
    In line 32 could return NULL if the file can't be created (maybe already exist a file with the same name and the same type)
    
9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
    
    I think has to do with the number of elements to be counted, in this case just one, the structure in turn.
    
10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
    
    3
    
11. What does fseek do?
    
    Looks for certain position within the content of a specified file or varible.
    
12. What is SEEK_CUR?
    
    Specifies the current position of the file
